Command line parser
===================
This project has made for educational purposes. You may do whatever you
want with it.

Description
===========
Simple command line parser for my future projects

Usage
=====
An object of class 'CLArgsParser' has three collections:
    possibleOptions -   contains avaible options
    receivedOptions -   contains options set by application user
    arguments       -   contains rest arguments

You may specify which option should process your application by this
command:
    CLArgsParser par = new CLArgsParser();
    par.addPossibleOption(new CLOptionBuilder()
            .name("help")
            .hasArg()
            .description("Print help page")
            .buildCLOption());
In that example we've specified a new option by 'CLOptionBuilder' with
name 'help'. This option needs an argument (.hasArg()) and it has a
description

Than you can pass String array received from the user to parser:
    public static void main(String[] agrs) {
        ...
        par.processInput(args);
        ...
    }
Now you can invoke .getReceived() to get all received options and/or
.getArguments to get all received arguments (which are not options)
